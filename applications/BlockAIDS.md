### Overview

BlockAIDS -  a decentralized electronic ecosystem on the blockchain, that allows millions of people living with HIV and key affected populations (drug users, LGBT, sex workers, etc.) to access their records, medicines, goods and services from any place in the world. 

We have now in our ecosystem 19 service centers (physical locations that provide people living with HIV with medicines and services). Our electronic software counts 50k active users and over 1 mln transactions (medical records) only in Moldova. And we are now building a global electronic storage for 5 countries (Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan) and more than 1 million of users.  Our project is supported by international organizations from the UN family, such as UNAIDS.

We are building for our users (people living with HIV and key affected populations) the Loyalty and Reward Electronic System - a subnet designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors and preventive measures for individuals living with HIV as well as those from high-risk groups such as drug users, LGBT individuals, and sex workers. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

How the project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama:
- Interoperability: Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama are designed to facilitate interoperability between different blockchains. BlockAIDS can utilize this feature to connect with other relevant healthcare and identity verification platforms, enabling seamless sharing of health records and other crucial information across different networks.
- Customizable Chains: Substrate allows developers to create customized blockchains with specific functionalities. BlockAIDS can tailor its blockchain to meet the unique needs of its user base, incorporating features that enhance data privacy, security, and accessibility for people living with HIV and key affected populations.
- Scalability: With the ability to connect to a scalable network like Polkadot or Kusama, BlockAIDS can accommodate a growing number of users and transactions without compromising performance. This is crucial for maintaining a responsive and efficient ecosystem as more individuals join the platform.
- Shared Security: Polkadot and Kusama's security model, which involves shared security among parachains (blockchain shards), can enhance the security of BlockAIDS. By connecting to a network where security is distributed across multiple chains, BlockAIDS can mitigate potential security risks.

**Why our team is interested in creating this project**:
We are working with People living with HIV and those from groups at risk for more than 10 Years, by offering them care, support and assistance. 
We have currently in our ecosystem:
- 19 medical and service providers centers
- ≈ 250 employees (doctors, therapists, social assistance providers, case managers, researchers, management team, etc.)
- 50k active users and over 1 mln transactions (medical records) in Moldova
- development team in source

### Project Details

Under this proposal we are building the following core component: **Loyalty and Reward Electronic System (LRES)** .
- The Loyalty and Reward Electronic System (LRES) is a key component of BlockAIDS, designed to incentivize healthy behaviors and preventive measures for individuals living with HIV and high-risk groups. The integration of LRES with the overall ecosystem involves:
- Smart Contracts: LRES can be implemented using smart contracts on the Substrate, Polkadot, or Kusama networks. These smart contracts would define the rules and conditions for earning rewards based on user engagement in health-promoting activities.
- Tokenization: The rewards and benefits offered by LRES can be tokenized, creating a digital currency within the ecosystem. This tokenization can facilitate secure and transparent transactions while also providing an incentive mechanism for users to participate actively.
- Decentralized Identity: Integrating with decentralized identity solutions allows users to securely access their health records and services. BlockAIDS can leverage Substrate's identity management features to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information.
- Cross-Chain Communication: If BlockAIDS decides to operate across multiple chains in the Polkadot ecosystem, cross-chain communication mechanisms can enable the seamless transfer of tokens and rewards between different chains, maintaining consistency in user incentives.
- Oracles for Data Integration: Oracles can be utilized to fetch real-world data, such as health activity data or verification of preventive measures. This data can then be used to trigger reward distributions, ensuring that the rewards system is based on verifiable information.

**PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic**
Our team has developed an electronic platform for people living with HIV from Moldova, as a pilot country (web2 version). Our electronic software counts 50k active users and over 1 mln transactions (medical records). You may find below the link to our PoC:

**What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement**
We will not implement solutions that might bring vulnerabilities related to our users: (i) potential users data breaches (ii) fraudulent usage of our rewarding system (iii) other potential vulnerabilities

**For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits**
All the costs are mentioned in our Business Plan:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQygOcE4_ejOm97zotWRbbxHtpNsevaRYSa8WNyFY_4/edit?usp=sharing

**Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach**
The strategy:
- We are going to add to subnet/parachain our existing users (50k active users)
- Then we are going to expand our subnet/parachain gradually to other countries (people living with HIV and key affected populations) under the support of UNAIDS global organization.

Below are the user acquisition projections:
- 2023-2024:
Development of Mobile App (Moldova)
Development of Global Storage (5 Countries)
Web3 Development (DIDs & medical records on blockchain). Forecasted users: 220k
- 2025:
Digitalization (Mobile App on the blockchain & global storage) in EECA (20 countries)
Monetization of HIV R&D investments (20 countries). Forecasted users: 720k
- 2026:
Digitalization (Mobile App on the blockchain & global storage) in African countries
Expanding users (HIV, Tuberculosis, Malaria, Hepatitis, etc.)
Monetization of HIV R&D investments (African + EECA countries). Forecasted users: 2.7m
- 2027:
Digitalization (Mobile App on the blockchain & global storage) in the rest of the world
Expanding users (global healthcare market)
Monetization of HIV R&D investments (All countries). Forecasted users: 3.8m

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
This project makes up for Polkadot's lack of protocol/parachain that provides tools to reward and educate a dedicated community.
We are building for our users (people living with HIV and key affected populations) the Loyalty and Reward Electronic System - a subnet designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors and preventive measures for individuals living with HIV as well as those from high-risk groups such as drug users, LGBT individuals, and sex workers. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

**Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**
our own user base

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**
No, as far as we studied. We are trying to build something similar to Human Protocol.
